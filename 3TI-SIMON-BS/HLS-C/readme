The original design of TI3-SIMON-Bit-Serialized is similar to the two-share brother version of it as mentioned in Section 2.2.3, with one more share of keySchedule module and an integrated datapath module that hold countable for encryption across the three shares instead of several instances of datapath\_share module. Other than the difference in original design comparing to the two-share version, we implemented this design in C++ with the same coding manner, noticing that although separating modules with their own .cpp source file and .hpp header file might seems clean and easy-to-read, it can be tricky when checking if all IOs are properly connected one signal by one signal- this will also be discussed in Section 4.2 for further details and also impacts on development effort.
