The TI implementation of LED involves modifying the round function to ensure secure operation at the bit level. This modification includes the introduction of a one-bit register to temporarily store intermediate values, which helps prevent unintended leakages. By operating on individual bits, the implementation effectively maintains security while processing all 64 bits of the data.

The HLS implementation is a nearly complete equivalent representation in C.
