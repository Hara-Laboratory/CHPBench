The round-based implementation of 2-TI SIMON involves a traditional approach where the entire data-path is duplicated to create two shares. This design processes each round in two clock cycles: the first cycle updates intermediate values, and the second cycle completes the round function. This method simplifies the key schedule as it involves only linear operations. The implementation effectively balances between area and performance, with a noted reduction in clock cycles compared to the bit-serialized approach, yet it requires more logic resources.

The HLS implementation is a nearly complete equivalent representation in C.
