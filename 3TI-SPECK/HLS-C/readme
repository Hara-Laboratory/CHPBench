Similar as TI2-SIMON-Round-Based project, the author also did not provide the top-module for their TI3-SPECK core. Unlike SIMON, original SPECK was different in terms of input output sequences, and numbers of round and cycles during encryption is also different, which goes through 64 rounds and 32 cycles per round, having a total of 2048 cycles during encryption. After encryption has been done, the SPECK core output 3 shares of 2bit signals for 64 more rounds, and after XORing up all three shares together we can obtain the final output.

In the developing of the top-module for TI3-SPECK core, we mainly regarded to the core testbench as the reference as it describe the detailed behavior of feeding three share of input stream into core module and then set initial input signal for the core to start working. Comparing to SIMON's top-module, SPECK's top-module seems to need a lot less functionalities, which includes switching through states after 128 cycles of data input and after 68 rounds of operation. After implementing the logic describe above, basic IO signals like "reset","done","start" were also added and connected to the core's according port.
