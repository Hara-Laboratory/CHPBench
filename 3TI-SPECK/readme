A bit-serialized implementation of SPECK has been proposed to achieve minimal area footprint while maintaining reasonable performance. In this approach, the arithmetic addition between two n-bit words is implemented as n serialized one-bit additions.

The HLS implementation is a nearly complete equivalent representation in C.
