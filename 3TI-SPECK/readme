A bit-serialized implementation of SPECK has been proposed to achieve minimal area footprint while maintaining reasonable performance. In this approach, the arithmetic addition between two n-bit words is implemented as n serialized one-bit additions.
To provide resistance against first-order side-channel attacks, a TI of SPECK has been developed. The TI approach involves splitting the secrets (both the key and plaintext) into multiple shares and processing them independently. For SPECK, the secrets are split into three shares, fulfilling the requirements of correctness, non-completeness, and uniformity.

The HLS implementation is a nearly complete equivalent representation in C.
